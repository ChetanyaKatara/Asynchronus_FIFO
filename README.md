# Asynchronus_FIFO
Hello everyone, I am Chetanya Katara, a Pre-final year student at Motilal Nehru National Institute of Technology. Here I am presenting you my project which is 
implementing an asynchronus FIFO using Verilog HDL to allow Clock Domain Crossing.

The idea used here is a Two-Flop synchronizer which takes grey code input in order to synchronize the write and read domain. 

Hope you like it.

For doubts or any advice connect with me on LinkdIn.
